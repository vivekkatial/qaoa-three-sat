Installation and Getting Started
================================

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can start writing using these resources, you will need Python 3.6.2 and the Python package manager `pip`. I recommend
installing `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__ for an all-in-one
installation of Python 3.6.2. If you don't have `pip`, it can be installed with
``easy_install pip``.

Installation
------------

You can install the code directly from the GitHub repository using:

::

  $ git clone https://github.com/vivekkatial/qaoa-three-sat.git
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
